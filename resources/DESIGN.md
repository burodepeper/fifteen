# Design rationale

This document contains the 'rules' the design intends and attempts to follow to achieve a consistent look. These rules aren't set in stone, but should be followed to the letter as much as possible. The value of this typeface is in its usefullness, and less in its esthetics. The user is supposed to be able to rely on certain (unwritten) expectations as to 'reading' each separate character, and avoiding confusion with other characters.

All remarks, unless otherwise noted, are about Regular.

## Dimensions

- Horizontal and vertical stems share the same weight; thin is 50 points, regular is 100 points, bold is 150 points.
- All dimensions are in multiples of 50 points, which is equal to a single subpixel at 15pt.
- The minimum distance between defining characteristics is 150 points.
- Regular holds the primary shape of a glyph. The Light and Bold variants are 'replacements' for the Regular, and as such, do not change the width of the shape. Ideally, the height of the shape stays the same, although these is more fluid.

### Sidebearings

- The average sidebearings is 100 points. In other words, the default expected spacing between two glyphs with a stem width of 100 points, is 200 points.

### Modifying letters

#### Slashes through stems and shapes

- Slashes through shapes (such as circles) have a preferred angle of 45ยบ.
- A slash has a minimal extension of 150 points in all weights.
- When slashing a horizontal or vertical stem:
  - the balance between the extension is either equal, or in a 1:2 ratio, where 1 is the outside, and 2 the inside;
  - the slashes have a preferred angle of 60ยบ;
  - the sidebearings do not take the slash into account;
  - the point where the slashes crosses the stem is centered;

## Diacritics

- The minimum size of a diacritic is 300 points.
- The approximate distance between a diacritic and its glyph is 300 points.
