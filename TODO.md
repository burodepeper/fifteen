## Glyph improvements

- [ ] Draw spaces besides a 'normal' space (non-breaking space for instance) as a very thin box
- [ ] Adjust position of underscore so it fits in somewhere in between x-height baseline and capitals baseline
- [ ] Set parameters for position and size of the underline

## Webfonts

- [ ] Automatically build subsets with a limited character set to reduce the size of the webfont downloads
